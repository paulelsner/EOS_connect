name: Develop - build image and push
# This workflow builds and pushes a Docker image to GitHub Container Registry
# and optionally to Docker Hub.
# It runs nightly at 2 AM UTC and can also be triggered manually.
# The image is tagged with "nightly" and the repository owner is converted to lowercase.
# The workflow uses the GITHUB_TOKEN secret for authentication with GitHub Container Registry.
# Uncomment the Docker Hub section if you want to push to Docker Hub as well.
# The Docker Hub credentials should be stored in the repository secrets as DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD.
# The workflow is triggered on a schedule and can also be run manually.
