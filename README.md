## Current Status

This project is in its early stages and is actively being developed and enhanced.

2025-04-10

- EOS made a breaking change - see here https://github.com/Akkudoktor-EOS/EOS/discussions/513
- there were also changes in the API at '<your_ip>:8503' - unfortunately the API is not versioned (*ping* ;-) )
- to fullfil both versions there is small hack to identify the connected EOS
- finally the current version can run with both EOS versions

---

## Quick Start

Get up and running with EOS Connect in just a few steps!

### 1. Requirements

- **Home Assistant** (recommended for most users)  
  *(Or see [Installation and Running](#installation-and-running) for Docker and local options)*
- **An already running instance of [EOS (Energy Optimization System)](https://github.com/Akkudoktor-EOS/EOS)**  
  EOS Connect acts as a client and requires a reachable EOS server for optimization and control.

### 2. Install via Home Assistant Add-on

- Add the [ohAnd/ha_addons](https://github.com/ohAnd/ha_addons) repository to your Home Assistant add-on store.
- Install both the **EOS Add-on** and the **EOS Connect Add-on**.
- Configure both add-ons via the Home Assistant UI.
- Start both add-ons.  
  The EOS Connect web dashboard will be available at [http://homeassistant.local:8081](http://homeassistant.local:8081) (or your HA IP).

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fohand%2Fha_addons)

### 3. Configure

- On first start, a default `config.yaml` will be created in the add-on’s config folder.
- Edit this file via the Home Assistant add-on UI to set your EOS server address and other options.
- See the [CONFIG_README](src/CONFIG_README.md) for full configuration details.

### 4. Explore

- Open the web dashboard at [http://homeassistant.local:8081](http://homeassistant.local:8081) (or your HA IP).
- Check live data, forecasts, and system status.
- Integrate with your automation tools using the [Web API](#web-api-restjson) or [MQTT](#mqtt---provided-data-and-possible-commands).

## How it Works

### Base

**EOS Connect** is a self-running system that periodically collects:
- Local energy consumption data.
- PV solar forecasts for the next 48 hours.
- Upcoming energy prices.

Using this data, a request is sent to EOS, which creates a model predicting the energy needs based on different energy sources and loads (grid, battery, PV).

**EOS Connect** waits for the response from EOS (e.g., ~2 min 15 sec for a full 48-hour prediction on a Raspberry Pi 5). After receiving the response, it is analyzed to extract the necessary values.

Finally, the system sets up the inverter based on the following states:
- `MODE_CHARGE_FROM_GRID` with a specific target charging power (based on your configuration).
- `MODE_AVOID_DISCHARGE`.
- `MODE_DISCHARGE_ALLOWED` with a specific target maximum discharging power (based on your configuration).

The system repeats this process periodically, e.g., every 3 minutes, as defined in the configuration.

### Collecting Data

Data collection for load forecasting is based on your existing load data provided by an OpenHAB or Home Assistant instance (using the persistence of each system). EOS requires a load forecast for today and tomorrow.

#### Home Assistant
Load data is retrieved from:
- Today one week ago, averaged with today two weeks ago.
- Tomorrow one week ago, averaged with tomorrow two weeks ago.
- **Car Load Adjustment**: If an electric vehicle (EV) is/ was connected, its load is subtracted from the household load to ensure accurate forecasting of non-EV energy consumption.

(See [Home Assistant Persistance](#home-assistant-persistance) for more details.)

#### OpenHAB
Load data is retrieved from the last two days:
- From two days ago (00:00) to yesterday midnight.
- **Car Load Adjustment**: Similar to Home Assistant, the EV load is subtracted from the household load to isolate non-EV energy consumption.

#### PV Forecast
EOS Connect supports multiple sources for solar (PV) production forecasts. You can choose the provider that best fits your location and needs. The following PV forecast sources are available and configurable:

- **Akkudoktor** (default)  
  Direct integration with the [Akkudoktor API](https://api.akkudoktor.net/forecast) for reliable PV forecasts.

- **Open-Meteo**  
  Uses the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) and [open-meteo-solar-forecast Python library](https://github.com/rany2/open-meteo-solar-forecast) for library-based calculation

- **Open-Meteo Local**  
  Gathers radiation and cloud cover data from Open-Meteo and calculates PV output locally using an own model (experimental).

- **Forecast.Solar**  
  Connects to the [Forecast.Solar API](https://doc.forecast.solar/api) for detailed PV production forecasts.

#### Energy Price Forecast
Energy price forecasts are retrieved from the chosen source (TIBBER or AKKUDOKTOR API). **Note**: Prices for tomorrow are available earliest at 1 PM. Until then, today's prices are used to feed the model.

### Example Usage

- **Monitor battery SOC in Home Assistant:**
  - Subscribe to `myhome/eos_connect/battery/soc` to get real-time battery state of charge.
- **Track optimization runs:**
  - Subscribe to `myhome/eos_connect/optimization/last_run` and `myhome/eos_connect/optimization/next_run` for scheduling info.
- **Visualize inverter temperatures:**
  - Subscribe to `myhome/eos_connect/inverter/special/temperature_inverter` (if Fronius inverter is connected).
- **Check if override is active:**
  - Subscribe to `myhome/eos_connect/control/override_active`.

You can use any MQTT client, automation platform, or dashboard tool to subscribe to these topics and visualize or process the data as needed.

---

**Notes:**
- The `<mqtt_configured_prefix>` is set in your configuration file (see `config.yaml`).
- Some topics (e.g., inverter special values, EVCC) are only published if the corresponding hardware is present and enabled.
- All topics are published with real-time updates as soon as new data is available.

</details>
</br>
EOS Connect can be remotely controlled via MQTT by publishing messages to specific topics. This allows you to change system modes, set override durations, and adjust grid charge power from external tools such as Home Assistant, Node-RED, or any MQTT client.
</br></br>
<details>
<summary>MQTT Data Subscribed</summary>



**Base topic:**  
`<mqtt_configured_prefix>/eos_connect/`  
*(Set `<mqtt_configured_prefix>` in your `config.yaml`, e.g., `myhome`)*

---

### System Mode Control (`control/overall_state/set`)

You can set the system mode by publishing either the **mode name** (string) or the **mode number** (integer).  
**Only the following values are accepted:**

| Mode Name         | Mode Number | Description                                 |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Auto`            | 0           | Fully automatic optimization (default mode) |
| `ChargeFromGrid`  | 1           | Force battery charging from the grid        |
| `Discharge`       | 2           | Force battery discharge                     |
| `Idle`            | 3           | No charging or discharging                  |
| `PVOnly`          | 4           | Charge battery only from PV (solar)         |

---

### How to Use

- **Publish a message** to the desired topic with the correct payload.
- The system will immediately process the command and update its state.
- You can use any MQTT client, automation platform, or script.

#### Examples

- **Set system mode to "Auto":**
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -t "myhome/eos_connect/control/overall_state/set" -m "Auto"
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -t "myhome/eos_connect/control/overall_state/set" -m "0"
  ```

- **Force battery charging from grid:**
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -t "myhome/eos_connect/control/overall_state/set" -m "ChargeFromGrid"
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -t "myhome/eos_connect/control/overall_state/set" -m "1"
  ```

- **Set override duration to 1 hour 30 minutes:**
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -t "myhome/eos_connect/control/override_remain_time/set" -m "01:30"
  ```

- **Set override grid charge power to 1500 W:**
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -t "myhome/eos_connect/control/override_charge_power/set" -m "1500"
  ```

---

**Notes:**
- The `<mqtt_configured_prefix>` is set in your configuration file (see `config.yaml`).
- Payloads must match the expected format for each topic.
- Any value other than those listed for system mode will be ignored or rejected.
- These topics allow you to remotely control and override the energy management system in real time.

## Configuration

With the first start of **EOS connect** a default `config.yaml` will be generated in the `\src` folder. For full documentation for the different entries go to [CONFIG_README](src/CONFIG_README.md)

*Note: With the default config and a valid EOS server IP/DNS name entry ('eos -> server') - **EOS connect** should be running out of the box with some static defaults as a start point for a step-by-step commissioning.*

## Useful Information

### Getting historical values

#### Home Assistant Persistance

The tool will use historical data from Home Assistant's local database. By default, this database is configured with a retention period of **10 days**.

To improve the accuracy of load forecasts, it is recommended to use data from the last **2 weeks**. 

You can extend the retention period by modifying the `recorder` configuration in Home Assistant's `configuration.yaml` file. If the `recorder` section is not already present, you can add it as shown below:

```yaml
recorder:
  purge_keep_days: 15  # Keep data for 15 days
```

After making this change, restart Home Assistant for the new retention period to take effect.

**Note**: Increasing the retention period will require more storage space, depending on the number of entities being recorded.

If you do not change the retention period, the tool will still work, but it will use the available 10 days of data, which may result in less accurate load forecasts.

#### Openhab

No specific info yet.

## Usage

The application will start fetching energy data from OpenHAB or HomeAssistant and processing it. You can access the web interface at `http://localhost:8081`. For local usage the port is configurable see [CONFIG_README](src/CONFIG_README.md). For docker usage change the mapped port in docker-compose.yml.
